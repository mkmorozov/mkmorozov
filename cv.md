#### 2019-Present, **Postdoctoral Researcher**, Université Libre de Bruxelles, Belgium

**Focus**: nonlinear chemical reactions in active emulsions.

#### 2017-2019, **Postdoctoral Researcher**, École Polytechnique, France

**Focus**: nonlinear dynamics of chemically active microdroplets.

* [Symmetry breaking in active microdrops depends on their deformability with highly-deformable drops exhibiting subcritical bifurcation.](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2018.853)

* [Unsteady reagent advection may be responsible for chaotic behavior of active microdrops.](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5080539)

* [Helical self-propulsion trajectories observed in dissolving nematic droplets may be due to the competition between nematic reorientation mechanisms.](https://doi.org/10.1039/C9SM01076A)

#### 2015-2017, **Postdoctoral Researcher**, Technion, Israel

**Focus**: microfluidic devices powered by surface acoustic waves.

* [Surface acoustic waves may drive thin-film coating flows.](https://doi.org/10.1017/jfm.2016.728)

* [Surface acoustic waves may accelerate the drainage of a thin liquid film that is sandwiched between a bubble and a solid substrate.](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.95.052803)

* [Review of transport and wetting phenomena driven by surface acoustic waves.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cocis.2017.12.002)

#### 2009-2015, **Ph.D. Candidate**, Technion, Israel

**Focus**: Marangoni convection in thin films of surfactant solutions.

* [Long-wave evolution equations of oscillatory Marangoni convection break down at high Marangoni numbers.](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4807599)

* [Dynamics of surfactant sorption may affect the formation of convective patterns in thin liquid films.](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.4901950)
